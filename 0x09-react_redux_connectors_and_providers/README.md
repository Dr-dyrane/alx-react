## Project Overview

This project focuses on integrating Redux into a React application, aiming to achieve the following objectives:

- Implement Redux connectors and providers
- Use Redux middleware like Redux Thunk
- Write tests for Redux actions, reducers, and selectors
- Optimize performance using selectors and memoization with Redux Reselect
- Enhance code organization and maintainability

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dr-dyrane/alx-react.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd alx-react/0x09-react_redux_connectors_and_providers
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To start the development server and run the project, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This command will start the development server and open the project in your default web browser.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the React application.
  - `components/`: Contains React components.
  - `actions/`: Contains Redux action creators.
  - `reducers/`: Contains Redux reducers.
  - `selectors/`: Contains Redux selectors.
  - `middleware/`: Contains Redux middleware implementations.
  - `utils/`: Contains utility functions.
- `tests/`: Contains test files for components, actions, reducers, and selectors.
- `public/`: Contains static assets and HTML template files.

## Tasks Overview

This project consists of multiple tasks, each focusing on a specific aspect of integrating Redux with React. The tasks include:

- Task 0: Writing mapStateToProps
- Task 1: Creating a small store
- Task 2: Testing mapStateToProps and updating App component
- Task 3: Implementing async actions and Thunk middleware
- Task 4: Combining reducers and modifying application
- Task 5: Connecting notifications and updating UI
- Task 6: Memoized selectors with Redux Reselect
- Task 7: Implementing containers and components
- Task 8: Creating course selector and fetch function

Detailed descriptions of each task can be found in the project requirements.

## Testing

This project includes a comprehensive testing suite to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase. Tests cover components, actions, reducers, selectors, and middleware. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This command will execute all tests and provide feedback on their success or failure.

## Redux DevTools

The project supports the Redux DevTools extension for Chrome, allowing for easier debugging and monitoring of Redux actions and state changes. To enable the Redux DevTools, follow the instructions provided in the project's index.js file.
